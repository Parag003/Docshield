## Overview

The *A Decentralized Document Holder* is an application that allows users to securely store and manage their documents in a decentralized manner. It provides enhanced access control and security measures to protect sensitive information.

## Key Features

- *Decentralized Storage*: Utilizes blockchain technology to store documents across a distributed network, ensuring high availability and redundancy.
- *Enhanced Access Control*: Implements robust access control mechanisms, including role-based access control (RBAC) and encryption, to prevent unauthorized access.
- *Security Measures*: Implements advanced encryption algorithms and security protocols to safeguard document integrity and confidentiality.
- *User-Friendly Interface*: Provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface for easy document management and retrieval.
- *Versioning and Audit Trail*: Maintains a history of document versions and an audit trail to track changes and ensure accountability.

## Architecture

The application follows a client-server architecture with the following components:

- *Client*: The user interface layer that allows users to interact with the application and manage their documents.
- *Server*: The backend layer responsible for processing user requests, handling document storage and retrieval, and enforcing access control policies.
- *Blockchain Network*: The decentralized network of nodes that store and replicate the encrypted documents.
